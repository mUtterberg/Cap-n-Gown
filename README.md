Repo for building "Woke" Virtual Guidance Counselor app

ABOUT: I was inspired by the JP Morgan "Women in STEM" category and by my students. I'm a full-time high school math teacher and often get asked for career advice by my students. After researching available career guidance web/mobile apps, I decided that a gender balanced recommendation algorithm was not already addressed. When my app is ready, it will collect user input on gender, preferences, etc and return recommendations in a particular order: clusters of recommendations will be generated based on compatibility with user-indicated preferences and each cluster of recommendations will be returned to the user in descending order of gender representation. In other words, jobs/careers/fields in which women are underrepresented will appear at the top of female lists for each given cluster and jobs/careers/fields in which men are underrepresented will appear at the top of male lists for each given cluster. So similar users may receive the same suggestions, but in a different order.
